# BODKit
Toolkit for the implementation of "the Benefit of the Doubt" (BOD) composite index

## Supported languages

## Licensing information
Feel free to borrow the code or part of. If it has great help in your research please make a note thank this github depository. If you con consider this helped you in your business, I will feel greatly appreciated if you tip the Faculty of Economics & Business, University of Groningen with some research money. I face extremely high workload in teaching tutorials, it would certainly help to buyout teaching hours and exchange it with research time for more fun and useful stuff to the society.
