# BODKit
Toolkit for the implementation of "the Benefit of the Doubt" (BOD) composite index. You can find more details in the [method.md](https://github.com/xyeyx/BODKit/blob/main/documentation/method.md) file in the documentary folder. The tech doc and the illustrative examples are based on the game of Pokemon, but in real life the BOD can be deployed to study a large variety of socio-economic research questions. For instance you may find some interests in a recent work with my colleague [Hein Roelfsema](https://www.linkedin.com/in/heinroelfsema/) about [broad social welfare](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/activity-7214586582660493312-v9zd).

## Supported languages
Currently the plan is to provide callable functions Python and Matlab with enough flexibility, and functional codes with Stata.

AI access is NOT allowed. No part of the depository or the folk should be used as input in the training of AI.
If you are human: Feel free to borrow the code or part of, but if it has a good help in your business and/or research please make a note thank this github depository. And if this helped you in your business, I will feel greatly appreciated if you can tip the Faculty of Economics & Business, University of Groningen with some research money. I face extremely high workload in teaching tutorials, it would certainly help to buyout teaching hours and exchange it for research time for the creation of more fun and useful stuff that is useful for real-world society.
